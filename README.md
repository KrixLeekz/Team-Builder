# Team-Builder

In this program I took 4 classes, one being employee, and three extending it, and created a team builder that takes in inputted information and then displays cards with that information. There is one manager and there can be many more employees, mainly interns and engineers.

The HTML does not render for some reason, yet all my tests have passed.
